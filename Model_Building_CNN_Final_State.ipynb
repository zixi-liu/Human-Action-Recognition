    "We reached a pretty high accuracy of 95.9% on the test set. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, when using CNNs for edge AI prediction tasks, for example, deploying models on resource-constrained devices like smartphones, we may have several concerns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Computational Resources**: CNNs can be computationally intensive, especially if the model is large or deep. Edge devices often have limited computational resources (CPU, memory, and power), which may not be sufficient to run complex CNN models efficiently.\n",
    "- **Memory Footprint**: CNN models can have a significant memory footprint due to the large number of parameters they contain. This can be problematic for edge devices with limited memory capacity.\n",
    "- **Inference Speed**: Real-time inference on edge devices may require fast prediction times, but complex CNN architectures may not meet the latency requirements of certain applications.\n",
    "- **Model Size**: The size of CNN models can be large, making it challenging to deploy them on edge devices with limited storage capacity or bandwidth constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "With PyTorch, we can use the profiler to project memory usage of the CNN model and inference time to understand the bottlenecks. We'll fine tune these metrics by leveraging some model compression techniques to be suitable for edge computing as the next step."
